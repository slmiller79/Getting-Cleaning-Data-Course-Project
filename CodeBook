This code book summarizes the results reported in the `tidy.txt` data in this repository.



*   `README.txt` describes the process of how publishers of URI HAR dataset did the experiment and got the data result.
*   The project uses six inputs from the URI HAR Dataset  
    *   `x_train.txt` 
    *   `x_test.txt`
    *   `y_train.txt`
    *   `y_test.txt`
    *   `subject_train.txt`
    *   `subject_test.txt`.
*   The training and test sets were merged extracting only mean and std to create new data sets features and activity_labels
*   `features.txt` contains variable names corresponding to the columns of `x_train.txt` and `x_test.txt`. 
    *   Descriptive Variable Names
        1. `Accelerometer` 
        2. `Gyroscope`
        3. `Magnitude`
        4. `Frequency`
        5. `Mean`
        6. `StandardDeviation` 
*   `activity_labels.txt` contains the descriptive names for the activity labels from the numbers in `y_train.txt` and `y_test.txt`.
    *   Descriptive Activity Labels
        7. WALKING - subject was walking during the test
        8. WALKING_UPSTAIRS - subject was walking up a staircase during the test
        9. WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS - subject was walking down a staircase during the test
        10. SITTING - subject was sitting during the test
