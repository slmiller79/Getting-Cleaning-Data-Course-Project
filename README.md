# Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
Getting-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project Submission - Steve Miller
 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. To prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

Created R script called run_analysis.R to:

Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
